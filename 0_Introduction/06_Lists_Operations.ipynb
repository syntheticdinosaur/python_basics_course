    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we saw how to access elements in lists. In this notebook, we will explore how to remove and add elements to lists. Lists are mutable, i.e., after they have been instantiated, they can be changed. This can mean that elements (i.e., the contents) of the list can be removed or exchanged for other elements. This also can mean that new elements are added to the list. Different lists can also be put together to create a new list.  \n",
    "\n",
    " We will explore this in a couple of examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing Lists\n",
    "Before coding things yourself, here is a quick overview what changes you can make to lists.  \n",
    "First, we create a shopping list in python: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    shopping_list = [\"apples\", \"bread\", \"milk\", \"cereal\", \"tomatoes\", \"orange juice\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We decide that instead of apples, we want to have oranges. Since apples are the first thing on our list, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    shopping_list[0] = \"oranges\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "> __Note__   In Python, the _first element has index 0_! An index is something like a position in a order. Think about index as meaning how many steps from the start of the list you need to make to reach your item. Since apples are already at the start, we don't need to take a further step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we directly change the first element of the list to \"oranges\" instead of \"apples\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can check that we have changed the list by printing it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(shopping_list)\n",
    "    >>> [\"oranges\", \"bread\", \"milk\", \"cereal\", \"tomatoes\", \"orange juice\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking for Membership in a List\n",
    "We can also check whether the changed list contains \"apples\" or \"oranges\" using the keyword ```in```.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"apples\" in shopping_list)\n",
    "    >>> False\n",
    "    print(\"oranges\" in shopping_list)\n",
    "    >>> True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, to check whether a list doesn't contain a value, you can use ```not in```.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"apples\" not in shopping_list)\n",
    "    >>> True\n",
    "```\n",

It also introduced methods like `pop()` for accessing and removing list elements in one step. The next notebook will explore other types of iterables, such as sets and dictionaries.\n",
