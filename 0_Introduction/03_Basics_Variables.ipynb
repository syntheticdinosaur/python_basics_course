    "# Naming and Assigning Stuff: Using Variables\n",

    "* What are variables?\n",
    "* How to create and use variables\n",
    "* Updating variables with new values\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Values\n",
    "We now got some exercise using Python as a basic calculator. However, after evaulating an expression (e.g., 1 + 2 = 3), the result was lost and vanished into the aether. Nothing useful happened with it and we couldn't access it at a later time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do useful things efficiently in larger programs, a program needs a way to store and manipulate values repeatedly. A way to store a certain value for the program for later work is the assignment of that value to a specific name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Variables\n",
    "> This creates (or _instantiates_) a __variable__. A simplistic mental model for what a variable does is a box with a label (the variable name), that holds some contents (the so-called value of the variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, creating variable is very simple, like this in abstract form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    some_variable_name = a_value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">Technical term: Here, the equal sign ```=``` is what is called an _assignment operator_. In python, the name of the variable (think of it as the label on the box) is to the left of that operator, and the value (the contents of the box) are on the right of that operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Variables\n",
    "The name of a variable is arbitrary insofar as the name has in and of itself nothing to do with the content. Think of it like this: Giving your pet cat the name 'dog' is totally fine, as long as you know 'dog' refers now to your pet cat. Also, your cat remains a cat, even when called 'dog'.\n",
    "Here are some other examples for variables:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    apple_price_kg = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    my_cat_name = 'dog'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    i_like_icecream = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    close_enough_to_pi = 3.14\n",
    "```\n",
