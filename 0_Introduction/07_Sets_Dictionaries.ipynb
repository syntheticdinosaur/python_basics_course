    "- Alternatives to lists: dictionaries and sets\n",
    "- What sets are and how they differ from lists\n",
    "- dictionaries as key-value pairs for better look-up of values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Lists belong to a class of objects which are called iterables. They are called like that because they may contain multiple objects that you can access. Iterables are collections of different items. But there are other iterables beyond lists with other properties, for specific uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sets\n",
    "One example for another iterable that comes in handy at times is the ```set```. A set, like the mathematical structure of the same name, doesn't care about order, or about multiple occurences of the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Sets__ care only about membership: Something either is in a set or it is not. For example, if I ask you whether you have a pencil, it only matters wether you have at least one pencil or not. If you have 100 pencils, you'd still answer yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are useful for comparing whether two collections of objects have the same elements or not (their identity), or by which elements collections differ (the set difference).\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to fully grasp that now. Just know that there are more data types and that those might come handy in some places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into sets, let's see something about lists:  \n",
    "Lists care about the number of occurences, as well as the order of items."

    "\n",
    "As you saw, in lists elements can be accessed by their position. This is nice, but can be limiting. Another structure in python is the so-called _dictionary_, which stores key-value pairs. The key can be for instance a number or a string (to be precise, it must be a so-called immutable data type). The value however can, just like in lists, be any data type (even a list!).\n",
    "While lists store elements by their position (index), dictionaries store data by associating each element with a unique key. This makes it easier to look up values based on descriptive keys rather than numerical indices.\n",

    "### Creating Dictionaries\n",
    "A dictionary is defined using curly braces `{}`, and the key-value pairs are separated by a colon `:`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {\"key_1\": \"value_1\", \"key_2\": \"value_2\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in a dictionary can be accessed by the so-called 'key', e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "food_dict = {\"fruits\": [\"apples\", \"oranges\", \"bananas\"], \"vegetables\": [\"tomato\", \"cucumber\", \"carrot\"]}\n",

The next notebooks will provide a slight shift towards more general principles of structuring code, discussing logical operations and control flow. Control flow refers to the order in which individual instructions are executed in code and is important for building larger programs."
