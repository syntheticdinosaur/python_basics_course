The first part of the Python basics course contains an introduction to basic coding principles, how to create variables, basic arithmetic operations, as well as an introduction to control flow and conditional statements. It provides a first approach to your programming journey.

01. [Introduction to Python Programming](01_Intro_First_Steps.ipynb)  
   Overview of programming, variables, and the first steps in Python using a "Hello World" program.

02. [Python as a Calculator: Numeric Operations](02_Basics_Calculator.ipynb)  
   Perform basic math operations, and equality testing.

03. [Using Variables](03_Basics_Variables.ipynb)  
   Learn how to create, assign, and update variables in Python.

04. [Variable Types](04_Basics_DataTypes.ipynb)  
   Introduction to different variable types in Python (e.g., int, str, float, bool) and how to determine and work with them.

05. [List Basics](05_Lists_Basics.ipynb)  
   Introduction to creating and manipulating lists in Python, including indexing and slicing.

06. [Further List Operations](06_Lists_Operations.ipynb)  
   Learn about merging and combining lists, removing and replacing elements from lists.

07. [Sets and Dictionaries](07_Sets_Dictionaries.ipynb)  
   Introduction to other iterables such as sets and dictionaries, and their differences to lists.

08. [Logical Operations](08_Logical_Operations.ipynb)  
   Introduces boolean or logical values, as well as logical operators such as 'and', 'or', 'xor', and 'not'.

09. [Control Flow](09_ControlFlow_Loops.ipynb)  
   Shows conditional code execution in if-elif-else statements, and for-loops as well as while-loops.
