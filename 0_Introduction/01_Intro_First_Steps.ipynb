This compilation of instructions tells the computer what to do. It uses special words and logical rules to define instructions, which the computer follows.\n",

    "Programs are written in a certain programming language. There are many different programming languages for many different applications (such as C, Java, Julia, R, Matlab, ...). In this course, we will use the Python programming language, because it is easy to use, and can still do powerful things.
