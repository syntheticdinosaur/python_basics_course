    "One example of such a conditional statement is dressing apropriately for the current weather. For instance, if the chance of rain is high, then I will take a rain jacket or an umbrella with me. If it's cold, but not rainy, a warm pullover and a coat might be more suitable. When the sun is shining, I better not forget my sunglasses. We are comparing a current state of a variable with a number of cases. Either it fits the case, or it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next segment, we will first learn more about such logical statements. These statements can be used to control the flow of the script, which is the topic of the notebook following this one. We might do one thing if a condition is true, and another if its not."
