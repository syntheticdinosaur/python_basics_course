## What Are Jupyter Notebooks and Why Are We Using Them?  

Welcome to this Python course! Before we start coding, let’s introduce **Jupyter Notebooks**, the tool we will use throughout this course.  

### What is a Jupyter Notebook?  
A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive coding environment where you can write and run Python code, see the results immediately, and include explanations, images, and notes.  

Files ending in **`.ipynb`** are Jupyter Notebooks. Each of these files in this course is a standalone notebook focused on a specific topic, making it easy to learn concepts step by step.  

### Why Are We Using Jupyter Notebooks?  
Jupyter Notebooks make learning Python easier, especially for beginners. Here’s why:  

- **Write Code and See Results Instantly**  
  You can run small pieces of code one at a time and immediately see the output. This helps in understanding concepts step by step. You can also modify the code, experiment with different inputs, and observe how small changes affect the results.  

- **Combine Code with Explanations**  
  Instead of just writing code, you can include explanations in plain English. This makes it easier to document what’s happening and learn at your own pace.  

- **Interactive and Flexible**  
  You can tweak code, rerun it, and experiment freely without restarting everything. This encourages exploration and learning by doing.  

- **Widely Used in Programming and Data Science**  
  Jupyter Notebooks are not just for learning—they are used by professionals in data analysis, machine learning, and research.

### How This Course is Structured  
This course is organized into **folders**, each covering a broader topic. Inside each folder, you will find **multiple Jupyter Notebooks**, each focusing on a single, well-defined topic.  

- **Notebooks are numbered**, as they build on one another. While following them in order is recommended, you can also jump to topics based on your prior knowledge.  
- **The learning goals of each notebook are presented at the beginning**, so you know what to expect.  
- **Each notebook ends with a summary**, reinforcing key takeaways and reviewing what was covered.  

This structure allows for **flexible and modular learning**—you can follow the full sequence for a structured experience or skip ahead to specific topics if you have prior experience.
