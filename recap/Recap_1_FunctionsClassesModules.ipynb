    "In the last session, we covered several key concepts of Python programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions**:\n",
    "   Enable modularization by organizing repeated code into reusable blocks. Functions can take inputs (arguments) and may return outputs, making code more organized and flexible.\n",
    "- **Mutability in Functions**:\n",
    "   When functions are passed mutable data types (e.g., lists or dictionaries), changes made to these variables inside the function can affect the original variables outside the function as well.\n",
    "- **Classes**: Allow for bundling related properties and methods together, creating objects that represent entities with both data and functionality. This is a core concept in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "- **Modules**: Are collections of functions and classes that can be imported into other scripts. Using modules promotes code reusability and organization, enabling complex functionality without rewriting code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, you will find some questions with multiple answer options. Sometimes a single option, and sometimes multiple answers can be correct. You can find the solutions to check yourself at the end of the notebook."

    "## Core Concepts to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutable Datatypes (e.g., lists)\n",
    "\n",
    "* If in doubt, `copy` before doing stuff.\n",
    "* Check that your appending and reassignment operations are run time efficient when working with large objects.  `list = list + []` might slow your program down, and other appending operations (`list += []`) might be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions modularize code and promote reusability\n",
    "* Functions are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the name in snake_case\n",
    "* Function definition needs indentation, e.g. via a tab or four spaces\n",
    "* Functions may take inputs and specify return values; but they don't have to\n",
    "* Only one return statement is executed in a function call. Function execution is terminated when reaching return (useful for branching behaviour)  \n",
    "* __(!)__ functions may have outside effects, even if no return value is specified, e.g. when working on mutable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classes encapsulate data and behavior\n",
    "* A class definition starts with the `class` keyword, followed by the class name in PascalCase.\n",
    "* Class definition needs indentation, e.g. via a tab or four spaces\n",
    "* The `__init__` method initializes instance attributes and is called automatically when an object is instantiated.\n",
    "* Classes can have methods, which are functions defined within the class that may operate on the instance data.\n",
    "* Class variables are shared across all instances, while instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
    "* dataclasses simplify initialisation and class definition. They are useful to define an 'atom' of your dataset, in which multiple values belong strictly together.\n",
    "* dataclasses also make it easy to see which parameters your dataset will have and your code can expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modules provide a way to import additional functionality (functions, classes) into scripts.\n",
    "* Modules may have submodules, allowing for organized and hierarchical structuring of related functionalities.\n",
    "* Modules must be imported before their functions may be used; it is customary to import at the beginning of your code.\n",
    "* Module names may be aliased (e.g., `import math as m`) to simplify access to their functions and classes.\n",
    "* Specific functions or classes can be imported directly from a module (e.g., `from math import sqrt`), allowing them to be used without the module prefix.\n",
    "* Modules can be created by saving Python code in `.py` files, making them reusable in other scripts.\n",
    "* Python has a rich standard library of built-in modules (e.g., `os`, `sys`, `random`, `datetime`) that can be utilized for various tasks without the need for additional installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _addendum_  \n",
    "It is possible to import all functions from a module without a module prefix (e.g., the `math` in `math.sqrt()`) using `from module import *`, which is also called star-import. However, this is discouraged for a simple reason: Multiple modules that you import may have functions with the same name. When importing them without prefix, they cannot be told apart by Python. Therefore, it is good practice to avoid using `from module import *`, as it can lead to unclear code and potential naming conflicts (Hence, we didn't teach it).\n",
