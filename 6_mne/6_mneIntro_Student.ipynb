    "## Goal: Compute an Event-Related Potential (ERP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will analyze real EEG data to compute an **Event-Related Potential (ERP)**, a classic way to study how the brain responds to specific events.\n",
    "You will take continuous EEG data, extract time-locked trials, and average them to reveal a clear neural response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an ERP?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a person sees or reacts to a stimulus, the brain produces small, time-locked electrical responses.\n",
    "In a single trial, these responses are buried in ongoing brain activity, so they are hard to see.\n",
    "If we repeat the same kind of event many times and **average** the EEG segments time-locked to that event, the random noise cancels out and the consistent signal remains.\n",
    "That averaged signal — showing voltage over time relative to the event — is the **Event-Related Potential** (ERP).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MNE-Python: our tool for EEG analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **MNE-Python**, a powerful and well-structured library for EEG and MEG analysis.\n",
    "It builds directly on **NumPy** arrays, so under the hood, all the data are numbers in standard array form — but MNE adds rich metadata and many built-in functions that handle the tricky parts of EEG analysis for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of what MNE manages automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* consistent handling of channel information, sampling rate, and units\n",
    "* correct alignment of data and event timings\n",
    "* referencing, filtering, baseline correction, and visualization tools\n",
    "* efficient storage and loading of large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "You can (and should) look up the most important MNE classes and functions here:\n",
    "[https://mne.tools/stable/api/most_used_classes.html](https://mne.tools/stable/api/most_used_classes.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data types in MNE\n",
    "\n",
    "MNE organizes data into a few key **data classes**, each representing a stage of analysis.\n",
    "They can “stem from” each other — meaning you start with continuous data, then segment it, then average it.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Stage            | MNE class    | Description                                                                                         |\n",
    "| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Continuous data  | `mne.io.Raw` | The full continuous EEG recording. Contains all channels and the time series for the whole session. |\n",
    "| Trial-based data | `mne.Epochs` | Segments (short time windows) cut out from the Raw data around each event — one per trial.          |\n",
    "| Averaged data    | `mne.Evoked` | The average of multiple epochs belonging to the same condition — the ERP.                           |\n",
    "\n",
    "The data always move through this sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Raw (continuous)  →  Epochs (trials)  →  Evoked (averaged ERP)    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object carries an `.info` attribute that stores all metadata (channels, sampling frequency, etc.), so this information travels with the data at every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps you’ll perform today\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will go through these steps one by one, with explanations and guiding questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inspect the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Understand what an `mne.io.Raw` object contains.\n",
    "   * Look at the recording’s metadata (`info`), sampling rate, and channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select one channel**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Focus on one EEG electrode (e.g., “Fz”) to make the analysis simpler.\n",
    "   * Drop all other channels and observe how the data shape changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply a light filter**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Filter out slow drifts and high-frequency noise to clean the signal a bit.\n",
    "   * (We’ll use a broad 0.1–30 Hz filter.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inspect the events**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The dataset includes event markers showing when stimuli occurred.\n",
    "   * You’ll extract and visualize these to see how many trials and conditions exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Epoch the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Cut the continuous EEG into short time windows (epochs) around each event.\n",
    "   * Each epoch corresponds to one trial (e.g., one Flanker stimulus).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Average to get ERPs**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Average the epochs within each condition to create the final ERPs.\n",
    "   * The result is an `mne.Evoked` object, which you can plot and compare across conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Combine ERPs of different conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Average the epochs within each condition to create the final ERPs.\n",
    "   * The result is an `mne.Evoked` object, which you can plot and compare across conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Average to get ERPs**\n",
    "   * Visualize the ERPs\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of today’s exercise, you’ll understand how continuous EEG becomes trial-based data, how trials become averaged ERPs, and how MNE-Python manages these transformations cleanly and efficiently.\n"
