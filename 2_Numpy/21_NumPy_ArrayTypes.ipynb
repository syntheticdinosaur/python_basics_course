    "__In NumPy arrays, all entries must be of the same data type.__\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a NumPy array, every element in the array is converted to a single, consistent data type, called the **arrayâ€™s dtype**. This dtype can be any of several types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integer** (`int`): Whole numbers, with variations such as `int32` or `int64`, which specify the bit depth.\n",
    "- **Floating point** (`float`): Decimal numbers, like `float32` or `float64`, for various precision levels.\n",
    "- **Boolean** (`bool`): Representing `True` or `False` values.\n",
    "- **String** (`str`): Fixed-length strings, stored as `unicode` by default in NumPy.\n",
    "- **Object** (`object`): Allows arrays to contain arbitrary Python objects (such as lists or other arrays).\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy automatically infers the dtype based on the array contents, but you can also explicitly specify the dtype when creating an array. Mixing data types within an array is not supported; however, using an `object` dtype allows you to store different types if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will usually use numpy arrays with a single numerical type. However, just for the sake of it, let's explore arrays and their dtypes a bit."

    "This notebook has shown that NumPy arrays can in theory contain data of any type, but that all entries in an array are cast to a single type. The 'object' type is the most general of such datatypes. We have also seen how to create special arrays, such as those filled with zeros or ones, and linearly increasing sequences of numbers. These are useful in a variety of cases. In the next notebook, we will discuss array shapes in a bit more detail."
