    "We won't delve into details here, but just mention it. I'd also like to mention that there is a convenient short-hand for matrix multiplication in NumPy, namely using the `@` symbol, so that `matrix_a @ matrix_b` is the matrix product of those two matrices. The usual asterisk `*` implements the element-wise or Hadamard product, `matrix_c = matrix_a * matrix_b`, where `matrix_c[i,j] = matrix_a[i,j] * matrix_b[i,j]`).\n",

    "In this notebook, we discussed a variety of mathematical operations for NumPy arrays. We have seen that NumPy arrays support the regular arithemtic operations element-wise for compatible arrays, and that likewise multiplication by a scalar (i.e., just a single number) multiplies each element of the array by that scalar. We have also seen that there are multiple mathematical operations that can be performed on single arrays, e.g. to get the mean, find the maximum, or to sort values.\n",
    "In the next notebook, we will have another look at masking arrays, and combining different arrays into a new array. We will also learn how to append elements to existing arrays."
