    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a core library in Python designed for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to manipulate them. NumPy arrays are more efficient and flexible than Python lists, especially for numerical operations. They allow for faster calculations and support vectorized operations, reducing the need for explicit loops. This makes NumPy essential for handling complex numerical data in scientific computing. For this, it brings a variety of functions and classes to the table."
