In this section, we will introduce NumPy, a powerful python library for numerical tasks. We will first discuss the basics such as datatypes and operations, and then go a bit deeper to explore mutability, and the differences between views and copies.   


20. [Introduction to NumPy](20_NumPy_Intro.ipynb)  
    In this notebook, we show how to import NumPy and how to create a basic NumPy array from an existing Python list.   

21. [NumPy Array Types](21_NumPy_ArrayTypes.ipynb)  
    Introduces various datatypes an array can hold, and the concept that a NumPy array casts all contained elements to a single shared type.  

22. [Array Shapes](22_NumPy_ArrayShapes.ipynb)  
    Discusses shapes, and their influence on combining arrays, e.g. by arithmetic operations. We also discuss how to change the shape of arrays to make them compatible.   

23. [Mutability](23_NumPy_Mutability.ipynb)  
    We discuss the concept of views vs copies in NumPy, how that relates to the concept of mutability we learned before, and the practical implications thereof.  

24. [Numerical Operations](24_NumPy_NumericalOps.ipynb)  
    An overview of numerical operations between different arrays, or summary operations such as taking the mean, on individual arrays. Showcase for a lot of the potential operations supported by NumPy.  

25. [Array Manipulations](25_NumPy_Manipulations.ipynb)  
    How to combine and extend arrays.  

26. [Efficiency](26_NumPy_Efficiency.ipynb)  
    A short introduction showing computational advantages of NumPy arrays.
