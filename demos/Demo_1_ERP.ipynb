    "# ERP Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive demo, you can explore how assumptions about the timing and synchrony of neural events impact the shape and magnitude of the averaged evoked response (ERP). By manipulating factors such as onset timing, phase synchrony, and noise, you’ll gain insight into what features the ERP method is sensitive to—and which meaningful neural activity may go undetected or be misrepresented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ERPs in this demo are simulated as a sinusoidal waveform with an exponentially decaying envelope. While this simple model doesn’t capture all the complexities of real neural activity, it effectively highlights the mathematical assumptions underlying ERP analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Play with the parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Trials, Phase Synchrony, and Onset Synchrony**: Explore their Effects\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Noise Level**: Adding Gaussian noise simulates the variability present in real EEG data. Observe how noise impacts ERP clarity, particularly when phase or onset synchrony is low, and consider what this means for real-world ERP studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guiding Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At what levels of noise and synchrony does the ERP method begin to lose sensitivity to the underlying signal?\n",
    "- Which settings reveal limitations of ERP analysis, and how might these impact the interpretation of results in EEG studies?\n",
    "  \n",
    "This demo is designed to help you understand both the strengths and limitations of ERP analysis, which you will often encounter in the field of neuromodulation and in the broader field of cognitive neuroscience.\n",
