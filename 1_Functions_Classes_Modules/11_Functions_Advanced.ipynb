You have already seen an example of a function with helpful default parameters when we discussed the `range()` function. Using defaults can help making function calls a bit more economic, and make some parameters optional. \n",

Additionally, if a function changes a global variable, it can unintentionally affect other parts of the program, which makes debugging more difficult. Using global variables also makes the function's behavior less clear, as it's not obvious what data the function depends on.\n",

    "In this notebook, we discussed how to add default arguments to functions, and how to add documentation to make it more user-friendly. We took a look at the behavior of 'outside' variables that have not been explicitly passed to functions, but rather existed in the global workspace regardless. Making functions rely on such external variables often is not desireable, and an anti-pattern of coding that should be avoided. In the next notebook, we will revisit datatypes, but this time, focus on a larger aspect: mutability. Mutability referes how an object can be changed in memory, and can provide pitfalls in more complex code."
