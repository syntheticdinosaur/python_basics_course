The class itself is like a manual or a blueprint: It provides a way to construct objects of a certain type - we also say that an object is an instance of a class.  \n",

Inside the `__init__()` method, you use `self`.variable_name to assign these values to the object's attributes. For example, `self.full_name = full_name` assigns the `full_name` parameter to the object's `full_name` attribute.
