This section deals with a bit more advanced concepts in pythons, namely the use of functions and classes. We also discuss the concept of mutable and immutable variables, and how that might influence your code. As a special topic, we also cover dataclasses, which can be useful to represent different data belonging together in a compact and practical way.

10. [Functions: Basics](10_Functions_Basics.ipynb)  
    How to create and call basic functions, and how to use return statements in functions.  

11. [Functions: Advanced](11_Functions_Advanced.ipynb)  
    Using default arguments in functions, cautionary notes on variable scope and an introduction to documenting your code using docstrings.  

12. [Mutability](12_Advanced_Mutability.ipynb)  
    We discuss mutable and immutable datatypes, how to test for the identity of objects, and consequences of passing mutable objects between caller and function.  

13. [Classes and Objects](13_Advanced_ClassesObjects.ipynb)  
    Introduces the concept of classes, and how to create objects. Also provides a glimpse at .set() and .get() methods to safely extract or modify class attributes.  

14. [Modules](14_Advanced_Modules.ipynb)  
    Teaches how to import (and install) external modules, how to use their functions, and how to use aliases for modules.  

15. [Dataclasses: Basics](15_Advanced_Dataclasses.ipynb)  
    Shows the concept of dataclasses, which are a compact way to represent linked data using specific objects.  

16. [Dataclasses: Fields](16_Advanced_DataclassFields.ipynb)  
    Introduces the concept of fields, which prevents multiple instances of a class from sharing ownership of the same mutable object if such behavior is not desired.
