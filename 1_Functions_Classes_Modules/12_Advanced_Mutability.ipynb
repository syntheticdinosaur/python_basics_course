    "* What actually happens to values when we 'pass' them to functions?\n",
    "* How can we test that functions don't change the original variables outside their scope?\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "We already talked a bit about data types, but one thing we did not delve into at the beginning was an important classification of variable types. Namely, a variable in Python can be either __mutable (changeable)__ or __immutable (unchangeable)__. Mutability is one of the things that you can ignore for quite some time, but at some point, it will come back to haunt you, especially in data analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhere in the computer memory, there exists an entry that is bound to a variable name. This memory has an address and a size, and the name of the variable refers to that memory address.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Mutable types__: These are objects whose values can be changed 'in place' after the object is created. You can modify parts of the object, add or remove elements, without needing to recreate the entire object. A mutable type that you learned about are lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Immutable types__: These are objects whose values cannot be changed in place. Once the object is created, you cannot modify its content. Any \"change\" results in the creation of a completely new object, while the original remains intact.\n",

    "## Summary and Outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored differences between mutable and immutable data types in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NumPy library which we will discuss later, you'll find that most of its array-like structures (such as `ndarray`; basically specialised lists of lists) are mutable, allowing for efficient computations on large arrays. However, it also necessitates caution: since multiple variables can reference the same NumPy array, unintentional modifications can lead to unexpected results.\n",
    "There is much more to know about this topic. If interested, you can for instance look into differences between a regular `copy` and a `deepcopy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mutable vs. Immutable**: Be aware of whether the objects you are passing to functions are mutable or immutable. If your function modifies a mutable object, those changes will persist outside the function, potentially affecting other parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Copying Data**: If you need to maintain the original data unchanged, ensure you create a copy of mutable objects before modification, e.g. using methods like `.copy()` or the `copy` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember the differences between mutable and immutable types. In the end, a core question is: What do data modifications should be shared between different parts of the code, and which procedures should not have outside effects?\n",
    "\n",
