    "*  What are functions and why are they useful?\n",
    "*  How are functions used in (modular) code?\n",

    "\n",
    "A function in programming is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task by executing a defined sequence of operations. A function has a name, and may take some input arguments, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a function was for example the usage of the `print()` function, as seen in a previous previous tutorial:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "    print('Hello World')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, everytime the `print()` function is called, it prints the string or number given in the parentheses into the console. This message is the function input. Using functions allows us to execute a predefined set of instructions without needing to enter them all in detail every time. Functions encapsulate chunks of code for convenient later, repeated usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Temperature Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that you want to convert a temperature value from degrees Fahrenheit into Celsius. This can be done with the formula:\n",
    "$$ °C = (°F - 32) * \\frac{5}{9} $$\n",
    "So if you want to compute different the °Celsius equivalent of different °Fahrenheit temperatures you can do it in the straightforward way!"

    "Here however, we re-wrote the same code in the print statement of each temperature conversion. While this effort here is manageable, it is still not a good coding practice for different reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, we messed up the formula, and for example instead of `*(5/9)` wrote something else. Correcting this would necessitate to correct it in each line seperately. Writing the same thing multiple times can easily sneak in a some mistakes (for example typos). Furthermore, if anyone later would read our code they would need to carefully check if every line does exactly the same or if there are small differences between the lines.\n",

    "* `parameters`: Optional. These are inputs the function can accept. You can have zero or more parameters. If you don't want the function to take any parameters, just don't put something in the parentheses, e.g. `def my_function()`:\n",
    "* Function body: Indented code block that contains the logic or operations the function will perform. The Function body must be intented by 1 tab-space (relative to the def line/function header) to indicate to python that all these actions need to be performed *inside* the function.\n",
    "\n",

For function definition, syntax and indentation matter, otherwise your function might throw an error. Functions help you to encapsulate reusable pieces of code with varying inputs and outputs. In the next notebook, we will talk about some advanced concerns of functions, such as adding default arguments and adding documentation for easier understanding."
